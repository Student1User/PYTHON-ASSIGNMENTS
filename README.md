# **Week 1 Assignment - Basic Calculator 🖥️➕➖✖️➗**  

### **Instructions**  
Create a simple Python program that:  
1. Asks the user to **input two numbers**.  
2. Asks the user to **input a mathematical operation** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
3. **Performs the selected operation** and prints the result.  

### **Example Usage**  
If a user inputs:  
```
Number 1: 10  
Number 2: 5  
Operation: +  
```
The program should display:  
```
10 + 5 = 15
```

---

### **Implementation Details**  
✔️ Accepts user input for **two numbers and an operator**.  
✔️ Performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division** based on the input.  
✔️ Displays the **calculated result** in the console.  
✔️ **Handles errors** (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).  

### **Enhancements (Additional Feature)**  
📌 The program was extended to include a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **Tkinter**, allowing users to interact with buttons instead of typing commands.  

### **How to Run the Code**  
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Run the script using:  
   ```sh
   python week1_calculator.py
   ```  

### **Expected Output**  
- If valid numbers and operations are entered, the result is displayed.  
- If a user enters **non-numeric values**, an error message appears.  
- **Division by zero** is prevented with an error alert.  

### **Learning Outcomes**  
📌 Understanding **basic user input handling** in Python.  
📌 Implementing **arithmetic operations** using conditional statements.  
📌 Using **exception handling** (`try-except`) for error management.  
📌 (Optional) Exploring **Tkinter** for GUI-based applications.
